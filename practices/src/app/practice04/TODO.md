### Task 4 Description
- [x] Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
- [x] The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
- [x] When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
- [x] The event should be listenable from outside the component
- [x] When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
- [x] A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
- [x] Simple output Odd - NUMBER or Event - NUMBER in the two components
- [x] Style the element (e.g. paragraph holding your output text differently in both components)

## Extra
- [x] Disable button `start` if the game is already started
- [x] Disable button `stop` if the game is not started
- [x] A `clean` button that will erase all numbers
